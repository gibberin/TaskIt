# TaskIt
A browser extension to manage tabs related to various tasks the user is pursuing

# Overview
Taskit allows the user to define personal tasks they are working on, such as 'Shopping', 'Messaging', 'Work', 'Finances' or 'Vacation Research'.  They further can associate tabs in their browser with each task to group them together.  Associated tabs are remembered by TaskIt such that the whole group of tabs can be closed and reopened at will.  In addition any changes to a tab's state, e.g. browsing to a new page, will be recorded by TaskIt as part of that individual tab's history.  New tabs spawned from existing ones will auto-associate with the spawning tab's group thus extending the task tab list without user intervention.  Most importantly, tasks and their tab groups will be remembered from browser session to browser session, so the user no longer loses their tabs when the browser, or host, crashes.  Tab sets can be shared with other TaskIt users as a means of exchanging knowledge around a given topic or task.

# Justification
Users rely on internet sourced information when pursuing personal tasks such as projects, research, shopping etc.  Currently browsers do a poor job of remembering what tabs are open if a browser crashes, often losing the tabs a user has been working in.  This can prove problematic if a user has opened multiple lines of research on an issue, or is planning to refer back to a tab at a later time.

Browsers also treat all tabs as part of a larger browser session.  They don't differentiate them based on the topic or task with which the user might associate them.  Thus the user is left to manage related sets of tabs, manually adding them to collections, or closing out tab sets when a task is complete and they are no longer needed.

TaskIt provides a means to group related tabs so they can be managed as a unit.  The user can store a tab set, reopen a tab set or move a tab set between computers very easily.  The collective tab history provides access to the entire information set associated with a task which the user can browse conveniently should they have a need to.  The ability to share tab sets by task provides a means to distribute information and knowledge around a given topic.
